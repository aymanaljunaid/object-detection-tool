# Object Detection Tool

A real-time, multi-source object detection web application powered by **YOLOv8** (via ONNX Runtime Web) running entirely in the browser. Supports multiple live and recorded video sources simultaneously with a detection overlay, face recognition, and an interactive dashboard UI.

## Features

- **Client-side YOLOv8 inference** — ONNX Runtime Web runs the YOLOv8n model directly in the browser; no server-side GPU required
- **Multiple source types** — Webcam, direct MP4 URL, HLS/M3U8 streams, local video files, and local image files
- **Multi-camera grid view** — Monitor up to 16 sources simultaneously with rotating detection
- **Single view mode** — Full-focus detection on a primary source at higher FPS
- **Face recognition** — Enroll faces and identify known individuals in person detections (face-api.js)
- **Per-source detection toggle** — Enable/disable detection independently per source
- **Detection overlay** — Bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores rendered on a canvas overlay
- **Demo mode** — Runs with random simulated detections if the ONNX model is not available
- **Dark/light theme** — Toggleable with persistence
- **Resizable sidebar** — Drag to resize the source management panel
- **Debug panel** — Real-time FPS, inference time, and active source counters

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 18+ (or [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.0+)
- A modern browser with WebGL support (Chrome 90+, Firefox 90+, Safari 15+, Edge 90+)
- The YOLOv8n ONNX model (see [Model Setup](#model-setup))

---

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-directory>

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or with bun
bun install
```

---

## Model Setup

The app uses a YOLOv8n ONNX model for detection. Download or export the model and place it in the `public/models/` directory:

```
public/
  models/
    yolov8n.onnx        ← required
```

**Option 1 – Download pre-exported model:**
```bash
# Using Python + Ultralytics
pip install ultralytics
yolo export model=yolov8n.pt format=onnx opset=12 simplify=true
# Copy the resulting yolov8n.onnx to public/models/
```

**Option 2 – Demo mode:**  
If no model is found, the app automatically runs in **Demo Mode** with simulated random detections, so you can still explore the UI.

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root. All variables are optional for basic usage:

```env
# Database (Prisma) — optional, for persistent face identity storage
DATABASE_URL="file:./db/app.db"
```

---

## Running Locally

```bash
# Development server (hot reload)
npm run dev

# Open in browser
# http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Build for Production

```bash
# Build standalone bundle
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start
```

The build script copies static assets and public files into `.next/standalone/` for deployment.

---

## Database Setup

The app uses SQLite via Prisma (for face identity storage). Run migrations before first use:

```bash
# Push schema to database
npm run db:push

# Or run full migrations
npm run db:migrate
```

---

## Usage Guide

### Adding a Source

1. Click **"Add Source"** in the sidebar.
2. Select the source type:
   - **Webcam** — Uses your device's camera via `getUserMedia`
   - **Video URL** — A direct HTTP link to an MP4 file
   - **HLS Stream** — An M3U8 live or VOD stream URL
   - **Local Video** — Upload a video file from your device
   - **Local Image** — Upload an image file for static detection
3. Enter a name and the URL (or select a file).
4. Click **"Add Source"** to confirm.

### Detection

- Enable **"Detection"** in the Detection Control Panel to start inference.
- Toggle detection per-source using the 👁 icon next to each source in the list.
- Switch between **Single** and **Grid** view modes using the view controls.

### Face Recognition

1. Open the **Face Memory** panel.
2. Enroll a face by capturing a frame and assigning a name.
3. Once enrolled, the app will attempt to match detected persons to known faces.

### View Modes

- **Single mode** — Displays the primary (selected) source fullscreen with full detection FPS.
- **Grid mode** — Displays all sources in a responsive grid; detection rotates across sources.

## Troubleshooting

**App loads but detection shows "Demo Mode"**  
→ The ONNX model file is missing. Place `yolov8n.onnx` in `public/models/`. See [Model Setup](#model-setup).

**Webcam not working**  
→ The browser requires HTTPS (or `localhost`) to access the camera. Ensure you're on `http://localhost:3000` or a domain with a valid SSL certificate.

**HLS stream not playing**  
→ Check that the M3U8 URL is publicly accessible and that CORS headers are set on the stream server. Some streams require the correct `Referer` header.

**Local video file is not detected**  
→ Ensure the video file is in a browser-supported format (MP4 H.264, WebM VP8/VP9). Very large files may take a moment to load.

**Face recognition is slow**  
→ face-api.js runs in the browser. Performance depends on device speed. Reduce the number of enrolled faces or lower the detection interval.

**Build fails with Prisma errors**  
→ Run `npm run db:generate` to regenerate the Prisma client before building.

## Deployment

The project is configured for standalone Next.js deployment. After `npm run build`:

```bash
# The standalone server is at
node .next/standalone/server.js
```

For Docker or Caddy deployment, see `Caddyfile.txt` in the project root for a sample reverse proxy configuration.
